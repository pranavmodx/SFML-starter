# SFML-starter

## Usage
1. Install SFML via package manager based on your OS (popular ones being 'brew' for MacOS and 'apt-get' for Linux distros).
2. Install CMake if you don't have it already.
3. Run CMake command in terminal from root directory:
```
cmake . -B build && cd build && make . && ./sfml-app
```
4. An SFML window should pop-up. You're good to go!
